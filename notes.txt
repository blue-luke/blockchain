I can only create 2666 child processes
So if there are more than 2666 loops of the script calling itself, it stops
ulimit -a
ulimit -Hu 10000 supposedly increases the hard limits, but this doesn't work

But refactoring so that the script calls a function also produces resource faults: segmentation fault

Refactor using ruby, and test drive?
